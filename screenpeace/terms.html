        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the ScreenPeace mobile application ("App") operated by PrimeWav Labs ("we", "us", or "our"). By using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old to create a parent account. The App is designed for parents and guardians to manage screen time for children in their family. By creating an account, you confirm that you are the parent or legal guardian of any children whose profiles you create.</p>

        <h2>2. Account Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and parent PIN.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>
            <li>You must provide accurate information when creating your account.</li>
            <li>You must not share your account with anyone outside your family.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

            <li>The App requires both parent and child devices to be in the same Apple Family Sharing group for full functionality.</li>
            <li>Phone calls and emergency services are never restricted, regardless of any screen time schedules or locks.</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for any actions your children take on their devices.</li>
        </ul>
