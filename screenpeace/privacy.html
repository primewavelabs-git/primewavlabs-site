        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

        <p>PrimeWav Labs ("we", "us", or "our") operates the ScreenPeace mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following information to provide and improve our service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Name, email address, and authentication credentials when you create an account using email, Apple Sign-In, or Google Sign-In.</li>
            <li><strong>Family Data:</strong> Child profiles you create (display names, avatar selections), screen time schedules, and daily usage statistics.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> A unique device identifier to link child devices to your family account.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Screen time usage minutes reported by Apple's Screen Time framework on paired child devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To create and manage your family account</li>
            <li>To sync screen time data between parent and child devices</li>
            <li>To send you notifications about screen time usage and schedules</li>
            <li>To manage your subscription and process payments through Apple</li>
            <li>To improve the app's functionality and user experience</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored securely using Google Firebase (Firestore) with encryption in transit and at rest. Parent PINs are hashed using SHA-256 before storage. We use Firebase Authentication for secure account management.</p>
        <p>Access to family data is restricted to authenticated family members only, enforced by Firestore security rules.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Authentication, data storage, and real-time sync. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Apple Screen Time APIs:</strong> FamilyControls and ManagedSettings frameworks for screen time management on child devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> Subscription management and payment processing. All payments are handled by Apple; we never see your payment details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. Your data is only shared with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firebase/Google for data storage and authentication (as described above)</li>
            <li>Apple for payment processing (subscription purchases only)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>ScreenPeace is designed for families. Child profiles are created and managed by parents. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children. Child device data (usage minutes, lock status) is accessible only to the authenticated parent account.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong> your data through the app's settings</li>
            <li><strong>Update</strong> your account information and child profiles at any time</li>
            <li><strong>Delete</strong> your account and all associated data through Settings > Delete Account</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnect</strong> child devices from your family at any time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Account deletion permanently removes your family data, child profiles, usage history, and schedules from our servers. This action cannot be undone.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active. Daily usage statistics are stored for up to 30 days. When you delete your account, all data is permanently removed from our servers.</p>

        <h2>9. Notifications</h2>
        <p>We send local notifications for screen time alerts (usage at 80% and 100%), bedtime reminders, and streak celebrations. You can manage notification preferences in your device's Settings app.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the app or via email. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
